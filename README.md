# Plant Based Pizza

A base repository for toying around with various different architectural patterns. The current base repository contains a monolithic .NET 6 API, with the plan to expand into:

- Service Orientated Architecture (seperate services, shared database)
- Microservice architecture
- Serverless Architecture

The intent is both peronal (for me to try new architectural patterns) and informative (with corresponding blog posts/live streams whilst adding new patterns).
